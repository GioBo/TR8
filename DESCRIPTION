Description: Plant ecologists often need to collect "traits" data 
	     about plant species which are often scattered among various 
	     databases: TR8 contains a set of tools which take care of
	     automatically retrieving some of those functional traits data
	     for plant species from publicly available databases (Biolflor, 
	     The Ecological Flora of the British Isles, LEDA traitbase, Ellenberg 
	     values for Italian Flora, Mycorrhizal intensity databases, Catminat).
	     The TR8 name, inspired by "car plates" jokes, was chosen since
	     it both reminds of the main object of the package and is
	     extremely short to type.
